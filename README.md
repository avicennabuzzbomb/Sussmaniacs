# Sussmaniacs
Scripts for general use in Sussman proteomics

* Includes a working draft for pulling GEE labeled peptides and finding 
their abundance in samples versus control samples (efficiency)

* Also a general use version that receives string arguments (example 
"GEE", "MetOx", etc. to run the script for several different 
peptide modifications of interest)
